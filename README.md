# Portfolio Site
This is a Next JS project for my portfolio site, meant to show off my work experience and projects, in a little bit of a nicer way than a CV.

## To-Dos

- Scale/Responsive design for smaller screens - 2 cols don't exactly fit Rome: Total War style- just move blog underneath?
- dark mode styling 
- Add other tidbits? like education, basic personality/interests if wanted

- Skills Icons/Logos in the section under blog since there's space.


- Component for blog post preview
- Component/format of each blog.

### Completed
- [x] Add component for job/project description?
- [x] project + job detail stuff
- [x] picture w/ personality 
- [x] Footer w/ social media links + grad cap w/ BSc CompSci from Uni of Notts
- [x] component for tools/skills list
- [x] background image/pattern

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
